These are all my [Sublime Text] dotfiles. [Sublime Text], have a very strange way to apply settings...  

A package (another word for *extension*, *add-on* or *plugin*), can [exist in different *forms*](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/customizing_packages), sometimes at the same time and many interesting files, have the exact same name, and are sometimes hidden inside packed packages...  

## [subextract]

All the settings in this directory is applied and synced with my script [subextract]. I created [subextract] to limit the confusion the default settings system causes.

## install packages

By populating the list *"installed_packages"* in: 
[SUBLIME_DIR/Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-preferences](https://github.com/budlabs/budlime/blob/master/packages/Package%20Control/Package%20Control.sublime-settings), **Package Control** will install any missing packages when sublime starts.
