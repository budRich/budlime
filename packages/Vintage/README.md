[Vintage] adds modal navigation to Sublime, very similar to VI. I have disabled some keybindings from the defaults, found in this directory. I have also commented out all the (four) pointless *EX* commands, included with the package.  

Additional keys are added to the keymap found in [VintageSanity] and [DisableArrowkeys] and [MoveTab].
