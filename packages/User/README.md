This directory contains the Preferences file that sublime will automaticly add user settings to, like when you switch themes, fontsize or add new words to the spellshecker. I don't recomeend manually editing this file (`Preferences.sublime-settings`), because sublime will autoformat it every time it is automatically modified (removing comments, blank lines and sorting keys in alphabetical order). Instead use the file with the same name in th `zublime` directory, that settings in that file will get merged with this one, and your comments are safe. Here is also the project that will get opened after budlime is freshly installed located, and an example sane snippet.
