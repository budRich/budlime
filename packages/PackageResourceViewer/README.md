## [PackageResourceViewer] - Plugin to view package resources. 
by: [skuroda]  

This package is a great way to extract and explore installed (and archived) packages. I have replaced `ExtractSublimePackage` with this one, since it does the same thing, but in a smarter way and has more features, it is also actively maintained and on the **Top100** of installed packages.
