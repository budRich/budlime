Use these files to add custom preferences and keybindings to Sublime. Adding them to the files with the same names in the `User` package (*which is the default way*), will result in **Sublime** autoformatting those files every time it changes a value (when you for instance change colortheme from the command palette). The settings in these files will get merged with the ones in the `User` package, and your comments are safe.
