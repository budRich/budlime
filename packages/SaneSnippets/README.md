## [SaneSnippets] - Sublime Text snippets optimized for humans, not robots. 
by [bobthecow]  

By using this your snippets will get stored in a much more sober format and be much easier to read and maintain. I actualy include a [fork] of this package by [math2001], that is more actively maintained and has better support for [BetterSnippetManager], (that is created by [math2001] and also included in **budlime**).
