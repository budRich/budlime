This color theme, is generated with [mondo], and the content of the file changes every time I apply a new  mondo theme. This Package currently includes both a UI theme, based of the default theme (so no additional files and images needed except this single theme file). And a "dimmed" (almost no syntax highlighting, except for comments and headings) color scheme, as well as a 8 bit color scheme. Also included are the actual mondo generator and theme file used to generate these files, so you can quickly create your own if you want.
