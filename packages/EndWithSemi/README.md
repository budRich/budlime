This is just a simple **macro** i created to end a line with a semicolon, (*a feature often desired in many programming languages*). Pressing
<key>Ctrl</key>+<key>;</key> will end the line with a `;` (*no matter where in the line the cursor is*) and insert a newline.  

It can also be seen as a template for how to create quick and dirty packages using macros (which are written by chaining sublime commands in **JSON**, instead of writing python packages.)
