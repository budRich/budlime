## [BetterSnippetManager] - A Sublime Text plugin to manage your snippets 
by: [math2001]

This package is great for managing snippets, since it lets you store them in 
subfolders of a "snippet" inside the user folder. Another reason I have chosen
to include this is that it supports [SaneSnippets] 
(another package included in **budlime**). To create a new snippet
just select a block of text and find: `Snippet: New` in the command palette.
