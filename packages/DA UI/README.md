GitHub user [ihodev] have created DA UI, as a continuation of `Boxy Theme` (by the same author). DA UI is the only package that actually makes it easy to customiz things such as the font in the sidebar, statusbar or other UI elements. 

[ihodev] have also made the package [A File Icon] that works really well with this package. He have also collected and tweaked a bunch of colorschemes, in the package [DA CS] that goes well with `DA UI`.  

I use DA UI in conjunction with my own theme engine [mondo]. See my sublime specific *mondo-generators* in the [mondo-contrib] repo.
