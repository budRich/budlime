## [ReadmePlease] - Plugin for quick access to installed packages README files. 
by: [roadhume]

Before I found this package, I had a dirthack in **budlime**, that would extract all readme files from archives/installed packages to a document directory. But this package handles that much smoother, just select `ReadmePlease` from the **command palette**, and you will get a list of all `readme.md` files associated with your packages.
