## [A File Icon] - Sublime Text File-Specific Icons for Improved Visual Grepping

This package adds file icons to the sidebar. The author, [ihodev], has created several cool UI related packages, such as `DA UI` and [DA CS].  

## ihodev M.I.A
Ihodev has removed all his packages, github repos and videos from youtube.
This package, A File Icon, is now maintained by sublime. 
But DA UI and DA CS is sadly not maintained at all anymore.  

I use `A File Icon` in conjunction with my own theme engine [mondo]. See my sublime specific *mondo-generators* in the [mondo-contrib] repo.
