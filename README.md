# budlime - [Sublime Text] related settings, scripts and links.
curated by [budRich] since 2018  

In this repo i will collect things that have helped me to achieve a good developing environment in [Sublime Text].  

## [awesome]

Contains a single readme with sublime related finds: recommended packages, tools, links, videos, and such.

## [wiki]

Short articles about sublime written by [budRich].

## [packages]

All my settings can be found in the [packages] directory. They are synced and applied with my custom script [subextract].

I use the official [Vintage] package to get some of the goodies from [VIM] in sublime, and many of the other package specific settings I have done reflect this.  

I try to change all keybindings involving the arrowkeys to something more *VIM-like*, and use <kbd>,</kbd> as **leader** in **command_mode** instead of the annoying <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>k</kbd> key combinations.

## [install]

The [install] directory contains a install script that will apply all my personal settings and download some related documentation with [GTFM].

## [scripts]  

Some sublime related custom scripts I have created.  

| script       | description
|:-------------|:---------------------------
| [tits]       | prints information about open sublime windows, by analyzing the window title.
| [subextract] | extract readme files, blank default settings and apply and sync custom settings.
| [sublaunch]  | Open a sublime window, with a specific project, file and instance name.          |
| [subdox]     | uses [GTFM] to download sublime related documentation.
| [browserpreview] | created to get a great preview of f.i. **markdown** files.
