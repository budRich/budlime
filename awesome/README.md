F.i. configuration files, which often have a syntax that only exist for that particular configfile (f.i. `i3wm`). `ApplySyntax` can set the syntax based on things like the content (looking for a specific line), or by evaluating the first line that often contains of a *shebang* that tells what syntax to use.
