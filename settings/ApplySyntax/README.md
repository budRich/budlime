## [ApplySyntax] - Syntax detector for Sublime Text
by: [facelessuser]


Sublime applies syntax to files by looking at the file extension. With `ApplySyntax` one can make more fine grained rules for how the settings are applied. It is very useful for files that have no apparent way to determine the syntax. F.i. configuration files, which often have a syntax that only exist for that particular configfile (f.i. `i3wm`). `ApplySyntax` can set the syntax based on things like the content (looking for a specific line), or by evaluating the first line that often contains of a *shebang* that tells what syntax to use.
