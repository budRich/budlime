I created this keymap to force myself to use the VI-navigation fully. But to be sure that all functions that uses widgets and panels in sublime will be usable, arrowkeys are enabled when widgets are active.  

But i try to use `TAB` and `shift+TAB` instead of arrowkeys in menus and such also. For this to work good i needed to add some extra rules for the tab key, also included here.
