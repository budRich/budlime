# Package Control
Sublimes, more or less, official package manager.
The two special settings I have applied to this package is:  

``` JSON
"ignore_vcs_packages":
[
  "SimpleSyntax"
],
"submit_usage": false,
```  

`"ignore_vcs_packages"` is a list of packages that should be completely ignored by Package Control, this is where I add my own packages.
