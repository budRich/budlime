## [ExpandRegion](https://github.com/aronwoost/sublime-expand-region) - Like “Expand Selection to Scope”. But better!

This is a great package that expands the functionality of the built-in `expand_selection` command. Therefor, I have bound it to the same key combination:  

``` js
[  
  { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+space"], "command": "expand_region" },
]
```
