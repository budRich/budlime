# [MarkdownPreview] Markdown preview and build plugin for Sublime Text
package author: [facelessuser]  

This package lets you preview markdown files as html in a browser.  

## browserpreview
I created my own companion scrip, [browserpreview], that will open and move the browser ([vivaldi]), to a specific postion and split the screen. With the help from [i3ass] and [sublaunch].  

### custom keybinding:
<kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>m</kbd>
