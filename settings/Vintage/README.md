[Vintage] is a core package that is disabled by default that adds modal navigation to Sublime, very similar to **VI**. I have disabled some keybindings from the defaults, (found in this directory). I have also commented out all the (four) pointless *EX* commands, included with the package.  

Additional vintage related keys are added to the keymaps found in [VintageSanity] and [DisableArrowkeys] and [VintageFinder] and [MoveTab].
