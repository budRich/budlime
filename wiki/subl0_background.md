I have been using [Sublime Text](link) for years. I was trying out lots of different text-editors and when I stumbled upon Sublime i bought a license after trying it for a week.

Back then I was on windows and I remember trying VIM which according to *the Internet*, was the king of editors. But I didn't get it back then. I blame the inconvenience of running it in the windows terminal.

VIM is a very potent editor, and the VI-bindings is imo the most powerful and efficient way to navigate and edit a text file.

But I don't want to give up on Sublime, especially when I have a license. And Sublime have many great features that VIM don't.

Luckily there are ways to get the best of two worlds. Sublime is shipped with a package(plug-in) called `Vintage`. Enabling the vintage package gives very basic VIM-functionality to Sublime.
