This is the first in a little article series about my text editor of choice, [Sublime Text](link). 

Sublime is proprietary software and a full license costs 80$, so it is a controversial choice. But I have less problem using and paying for this software then using, for example, "firefox". 

And the two things you get when you purchase a license is:

- Every 10th time you save a file, a nagscreen pops up, reminding you that your copy is not registered. This will stop once you pay. (hint: i3, scratchpad)

- You can install and use the 'dev' builds which get updated much more often then the stable version.

Otherwise it is the exact same program. So if you just want to try it out go to: [sublimetext.com](http://sublimetext.com) and follow the installation instructions.

After installation, you can launch Sublime with the `subl` command.
